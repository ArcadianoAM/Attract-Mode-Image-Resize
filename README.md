# Attract-Mode-Image-Resize

# A small program for Attract Mode, created with python that allows us to resize our game images in just one click, but obviously you can use it to resize any image you want. Enjoy.

# Note:
# 1) Make sure you have the latest version of Python 3.12 (64-bit) on your PC
# 2) Make sure you have the tkinter and Pillow libraries installed in your Python environment.
